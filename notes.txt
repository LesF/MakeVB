Publish for Windows 10

dotnet publish -c Release -r win10-x64 --self-contained -f net8.0-windows10.0.19041

VS2022 Publish was not usable, it opens Archive Manager and tries to create an Android package(?) and there is no option to create or edit a Publish profile.

Kept getting runtime error,  System.TypeInitializationException: The type initializer for '<Module>' threw an exception.
Added this to project file:
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Maui.Controls" Version="8.0.100" />

Found recommendations to add this too, not sure if it was required:
    <PropertyGroup>
        <WindowsAppSdkDeploymentManagerInitialize>false</WindowsAppSdkDeploymentManagerInitialize>
        <WindowsPackageType>None</WindowsPackageType>
    </PropertyGroup>

Context menu
Added 'Open with MakeVB' action to the VisualBasic.Project class:

	Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

	[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\VisualBasic.Project\shell\Open with MakeVB]
	@="Open with MakeVB"

	[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\VisualBasic.Project\shell\Open with MakeVB\command]
	@="\"d:\\Programs\\MakeVB\\MakeVB.exe\" \"%1\""
