Publish for Windows 10

dotnet publish -c Release -r win10-x64 --self-contained -f net8.0-windows10.0.19041

VS2022 Publish was not usable, it opens Archive Manager and tries to create an Android package(?) and there is no option to create or edit a Publish profile.

Kept getting runtime error,  System.TypeInitializationException: The type initializer for '<Module>' threw an exception.
Added this to project file:
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Maui.Controls" Version="8.0.100" />

Found recommendations to add this too, not sure if it was required:
    <PropertyGroup>
        <WindowsAppSdkDeploymentManagerInitialize>false</WindowsAppSdkDeploymentManagerInitialize>
        <WindowsPackageType>None</WindowsPackageType>
    </PropertyGroup>
